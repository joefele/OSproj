**Arante's CPU Scheduling simulator** 
-  is a web-based CPU Scheduling Simulator built using html, css and javascript. This simulator allows users to visualize and simulate through various CPU Scheduling algorithm's like FCFS(FIRST COME FIRST SERVE),SJF-NP(SHORTEST JOB FIRST-NON PREEMPTIVE),SJF-P(SHORTEST JOB FIRST-PREEMPTIVE),RR(ROUND ROBIN) AND MLFQ(MULTILEVEL FEEDBACK QUEUE).
ITS FEATURES ARE:
*MANUAL INPUT AND RANDOM GENERATED PROCESSES
*CONFIGURABLE MLFQ SETTINGS (TIME QUANTUM)
*COLORFUL VISUAL GANTT CHART OUTPUT with time metrics to clearly visualize and track the processes.
*DISPLAYS THE PROCESSES IN A PROCESS TABLE WITH HEADINGS LIKE: PID, ARRIVAL TIME, BURST TIME, COMPLETION TIME, TURNAROUND TIME AND RESPONSE TIME.


HOW TO RUN:
-Firstly, choose the number of processes u want to use or set.
-Then, select the algorithm u want to simulate.
-Next, Decide whether you manually inputs the processes or u click the button where it generates random processes based on your desired number of processes.
-Lastly, Click the Run Selected Algorithm and u can now visualize the gant chart and observe the process table and as well as the computed average for turnaround time and response time.
